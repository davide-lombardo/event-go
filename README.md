### Folder Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

client: Contains the React frontend application.
server: Contains the Node.js and Express backend application.


### Manual Development

You can run the application locally using the following steps:

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/davide-lombardo/event-go.git
   cd event-go/client
   npm install
   cd event-go/server
   npm install
```

2. Run the application:
- In one terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173/

   - In another terminal, start the backend:
```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
```
The backend will be available at http://localhost:4000/

3. To build for production:
```bash
   # In /client
   npm run build
   # In /server
   npm run build
```

### Run with Docker

If you prefer using Docker for local development, follow the steps below. This allows you to run the entire application in containers, ensuring consistency across environments.

#### Prerequisites
1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) on your machine.  
   - Follow the instructions on the Docker website to download and install Docker for your operating system.

#### Run Docker Compose
2. Start both the frontend and backend containers with:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- The frontend will be accessible at http://localhost:5173/.
- The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:4000/.

3. Stopping the Docker Containers:

To stop the containers, use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Testing

To run the tests use your preferred testing library (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library). Ensure that the tests are set up and configured properly to run them. No specific tests are included in this project yet, but consider adding them to improve quality and coverage.
